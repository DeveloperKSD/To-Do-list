📝 To-Do List CLI App (C++)

A simple command-line To-Do List built with C++ and file handling. This app lets you add, delete, and view tasks using a text file (tasks.txt) for storage.
🚀 Features

✔️ Add Tasks – Save tasks to tasks.txt
✔️ Delete Tasks – Remove a specific task by number
✔️ View Tasks – Display all tasks in a numbered list
✔️ Persistent Storage – Tasks are stored in a file and remain even after exiting
✔️ User-Friendly Menu – Simple navigation through options
💡 Concepts Used

🔹 File Handling (ifstream, ofstream) – Read/write tasks from a file
🔹 Vectors (std::vector<string>) – Store and manipulate tasks dynamically
🔹 Loops (for, while) – Iterate through task lists
🔹 Conditional Statements (if-else) – Validate user input
📜 How It Works

1️⃣ Run the program
2️⃣ Choose an option:

    1 ➝ Add a task
    2 ➝ Delete a task
    3 ➝ View tasks
    4 ➝ Exit the program
    3️⃣ Tasks are saved in tasks.txt and can be viewed anytime
    4️⃣ Deleting a task rewrites the file without the deleted task
